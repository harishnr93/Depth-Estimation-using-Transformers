# Depth Estimation from Image using Transformers

This Python script performs **depth estimation** on a user-provided image using the [Depth Anything V2](https://huggingface.co/depth-anything/Depth-Anything-V2-base-hf) model via Hugging Face's `transformers` library. It supports both image URLs and local file paths and visualizes the original image alongside its depth prediction.
